<h2> About AKTU</h2>
<p> Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Technical University (AKTU) formerly known as Uttar Pradesh Technical University (UPTU) was established by the Government of Uttar Pradesh on 8th May 2000 vide Act No. 1248(2)XVII-V-I-I-19-2000 Uttar Pradesh Adhiniyam Sankhya 23 of 2000. Under the University Act, 'Technical Education' includes programmes of education, research and training in Engineering, Technology, Architecture, Town Planning, Pharmacy, Applied Arts & Crafts and such other programmes and areas that the central Government may in consultation with All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) by notification in Gazette declare.

   U.P. being the largest state of India with an area of around two lacs forty thousand square kilometers and population of more than 165 million people makes UPTU as one of the largest technical universities not only in India but perhaps in Asia. Because of its gigantic size and number of colleges affiliated to it and geographic dispersion, it has been sub-divided into five zones with 150-160 colleges in each zone for the ease of management and facilitating inter-zonal comparison and possible internal competition to enhance quality of teaching-learning processes. UPTU envisions to facilitate and nurture the quality of technical education and research in its own premises as well as all affiliating institutions. The total number of affiliated colleges was 49 in the year 2000 which has now gone up to 238 and the University is still growing. The University Conducts State level Entrance Examination U.P.-S.E.E. for admission to various programs in institutions affiliated to UPTU and some Universities of U.P..

<h2 id = "myvillage">About My Village</h2>
<center><img src = "https://www.euttaranchal.com/tourism/photos/devprayag-9286235.jpg" width = "700" alt = "devprayag"></center>
<p>I am originally from Devprayag, Uttrakhand. Devprayag (Deva prayƒÅga) is a town and a nagar panchayat, near New Tehri city in Tehri Garhwal District in the state of Uttarakhand, India, and is the final one of the Panch Prayag (five confluences) of Alaknanda River where Alaknanda meets the Bhagirathi river and both rivers thereafter flow on as the Ganges river or Ganga.</p>
<p>Traditionally, it is considered to be the place where sage Dev Sharma led his ascetic life, giving birth to its present name, Devprayag. It is one of the five sacred confluences in the hills and is an important place of pilgrimage for devout Hindus.</p>
<p>"Devprayag" means "Godly Confluence" in Sanskrit. According to Hindu scriptures, Devprayag is the sacred place of merging of two visible heavenly rivers, Alakananda and Bhagirathi, to form the holy Ganga. On a terrace in the upper part of the village is the temple of Raghunathji, built of huge stones, pyramidal in form, and capped by a white cupola.</p>
